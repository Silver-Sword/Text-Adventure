# Untitled - Text Adventure

Currently in the earliest stages of development, this video game
will be a text adventure game, much like Kyle Is Famous, set
on a space station.

Premise: The protagonist is stuck in a time loop and the player will explore
the environment through branching choices to help the protagonist
escape.
