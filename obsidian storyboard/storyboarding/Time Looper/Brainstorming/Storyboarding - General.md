- Basic Premise: "Trapped somewhere"
- second run through discovers time loop mechanic
- memory loss?  - seems pretty overused

I want this first version to be the bad demo version to be replaced later.
The hope is that I can test my system and come up with ideas during the process to add here.


Setting: Either a space shuttle or a magical forest
How do I choose between high fantasy and hardcore sci fi?

Which one do I want to be roped into...? One to love. to caress. to nuture.

space ship obviously. okay then

something between that one time loop space ship game played by that streamer (could I be any more generic?), Markiplier's lost in space choose ur own adventure, and Kyle is Famous

I don't want to do any psychological horror stuff, as I don't think I can actually hit that target, but I do want to evoke some emotions. intense emotions would be nice, but maybe that'll be a later target...

In the meantime,
